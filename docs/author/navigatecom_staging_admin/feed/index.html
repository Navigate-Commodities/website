										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="paragraph-container">
<p>In light of the weakening demand backdrop for iron ore we <b>introduce the contestable seaborne iron ore all-in cost and margin curves to test price resistance levels</b>. We recently revised down our 2020 iron ore market balance from -30Mt to +4Mt; due to lower RoW steel production which will offset ongoing supply-side issues in our view. A sustained collapse in Europe and Japan/Korea steel volumes is the biggest risk to iron ore prices in our view, as seaborne cargoes become distressed as mills declare force majeure. We estimate the iron ore market was in a c. 20Mt deficit in 1Q20, which explains the iron ore price strength. However, <b>we expect the market to move into surplus in late May/June on higher Aus/Brazil shipments and lower ex-China steel demand, and for iron ore to retrace to US$70/t, before rebounding to US$85/t in 4Q on an expected recovery in global steel demand. </b>We expect Chinese port stocks to start increasing from current levels over the next 3-4 months.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph-container">
<p>Our cost analysis of the seaborne market shows that the <b>current marginal cost level (90th percentile) is around US$65/t (all in and grade adjusted). </b>Whilst we believe that during this downturn price could retrace to marginal cost support, <b>we also see it unlikely to test anywhere near the price levels seen during the last downturn in 2014-2016:</b></p>
</div>
<div class="bulletlist-container">
<ul class="list--default">
<li><b>Marginal cost support is around US$65/t:</b> Based on our global all-in cost and margin curves we think marginal cost (90th percentile) is around US$65/t (dmt, CIF China) and the 75th percentile around US$45/t. Over the next 3 months we think iron ore could retrace to marginal cost support. Our all-in grade adjusted cost and margin curve is based on GS overage 2020 forecasts for freight rates (e.g. Brazil to China, Aus to China), FX and premiums/discounts for high/low grade iron ore. We do note that the market is in a deflationary cost environment due to weakening commodity currencies and oil/diesel, and marginal cost could decline over 2020. The marginal and/or loss-making producers on our estimates at US$65/t are: China domestic (contestable with seaborne market), low grade Indian exports, and several Western world magnetite producers.</li>
<li><b>Market unlikely to test 2014-2016 levels:</b> In the last iron ore bear market of 2014-2016, the price hit a low of US$38/dmt, which was around the 60th percentile on the cost curve, but averaged c. US$56-58/t in 2015 and 2016. Despite the risk that RoW steel volumes may contract by &gt;10%, we believe this downturn is unlikely to test the price levels seen in the last downturn in 2014-2016 due to 5 key reasons:
<ol class="list--default">
<li><b>The market was in a large surplus position (30-60Mtpa) during 2014-2016</b> due to the ramp-up of new supply from the iron ore majors. <i>Conversely, the market was in a deficit before the onset of Covid-19 as seen by low and stable Chinese port stocks.</i></li>
<li>The <b>exit of high cost iron ore production (from China, SE Asia, India and West Africa) was slow during 2014-2016.</b> <i>This higher cost supply did not return from 2017-2019 despite high prices, and reserve depletion is only accelerating amongst Tier 2&amp;3 producers.</i></li>
<li><b>The majors brought on &gt;300Mt of new capacity from 2014 to 2016. </b><i>However, Rio Tinto and Vale have been struggling to increase production in 2019-2020 due to ongoing operational issues.</i></li>
<li><b>The rise of 80-110Mt of Induction Furnace (IF) capacity in China that used scrap impacted iron ore demand.</b> <i>These IFs were phased out from 2016 and have been replaced by large blast furnaces which has boosted iron ore demand.</i></li>
<li><b>A policy-driven downturn in the Chinese property market </b>from 2014-2015 impacted steel and iron ore demand significantly. <i>Chinese property is rebounding in 2Q20 with improving sales and starts.</i></li>
</ol>
</li>
