increasing 41.6% compared with the peak of 10.2Mt in March 2019.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, domestic rebar producers responded to decimated demand by making mass production cuts during this period.<\/p>\n<p>Rebar production rates were slashed 33.3% from 3.6Mt per week (187Mt annualized) in December to a three-year low of 2.4Mt per week (125Mt annualized) in March.<\/p>\n<p>That said, we calculate less than half of those production cuts (0.5Mt per week or 26Mt annualized) were a result of Lunar New Year vacations from January 25th.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Quarter 2: The Floods<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>With China emerging from lockdown in late-March\/early-April, the resumption of construction and infrastructure projects started to release pent-up steel consumption.<\/p>\n<p>Demand was so robust through Q2 that rebar producers were able to ramp up output to record levels without hampering a significant drawdown in national inventories.<\/p>\n<p>Rebar production rates surged 66.7% from the March lows (2.4Mt) to record highs of 4.0Mt per week (208Mt annualized) in late-June; 5.0% higher compared with the June 2019 peak.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, daily construction steel trading volumes peaked at a record 309,000 tonnes per day (113Mt annualized) in mid-May.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, national rebar inventories declined 47.0% to 7.6Mt in mid-to-late June from the 14.3Mt peak in mid-March.<\/p>\n<p>We estimate this demand strength was partly driven by the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-economy-bonds\/china-front-loads-142-billion-in-2020-local-government-bonds-to-spur-growth-idUSKBN1Y113D\">front-loading of a pre-COVID-19 RMB1 trillion (US$142bn) special bond issuance<\/a><\/span> announced in November last year.<\/p>\n<p>China\u2019s finance ministry stated that local governments must ensure that special-purpose bonds be issued and used as early as possible to avoid a sharp economic slowdown.<\/p>\n<p>That said, the pace of the post-COVID-19 steel demand recovery had little time to reach full stride given the onset of seasonal rains, resulting in large-scale floods across the country in late May.<\/p>\n<p>Such were the extremes of the rains and floods that approximately 63.5 million were affected, causing a direct economic loss of US$29 billion.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, daily construction steel trading volumes plunged 41.3% from their post-COVID-19 high to 181,000 tonnes per day (66Mt annualized) in early-June.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Quarter 3: The Rod of Indiscipline<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We calculate that floods slowed apparent consumption growth of long products from a peak of 7% year-on-year in May to a post-COVID-19-low of 5% in July.<\/p>\n<p>While adverse weather conditions hampered long steel demand growth, mills exercised less discipline with rebar production rates.<\/p>\n<p>Rebar production rates only declined by 7.5% from 4.0Mt per week (208Mt annualized) in late-June to 3.7Mt per week (192Mt annualized) in late-September.<\/p>\n<p>This resulted in a 17% or 1.3Mt increase in national rebar inventories from 7.6Mt (June) to 8.9Mt (September) over this period.<\/p>\n<p>With receding floodwater, construction steel trading volumes have rebounded from recent lows and apparent consumption growth has crept up to 6% year-on-year in September.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Quarter 4: The Outlook<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We anticipate Chinese construction steel demand, particularly for rebar, will remain seasonably robust through October and November.<\/p>\n<p>Most end-users will likely drawdown rebar from warehouses rather than procure freshly rolled material, as stockists cut prices to deplete relatively high inventories before the year-end.<\/p>\n<p>With mills scaling back output and \u201csocial\u201d inventories declining over this period, this will limit the scope of declines in domestic billet and rebar prices.<\/p>\n<p>Additional downside risk will be lower hot metal production costs, driven by iron ore, which will remove a modicum of some support from finished steel prices.<\/p>\n<p>That said, we expect hot metal\/<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/navigatecommodities.com\/iron-ore-what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting\/\">iron ore to decline at a faster pace<\/a><\/span> than billet &amp; rebar, resulting in a recovery in steel margins in the process.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, more competitive domestic semi- and finished-steel prices (and higher import prices) will narrow the arbitrage opportunity for <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/navigatecommodities.com\/stimulus-converts-china-into-net-steel-importer\/\">foreign suppliers to export to China<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, we anticipate China will reclaim its status as a net exporter of steel within the next three months.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Upside risks to Q4 forecast<\/h3>\n<p>Rest of the World blast furnace production, iron ore consumption &amp; costs rebound sharply, pressuring Chinese steel prices higher \u2013 <strong>possible.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Intermittent environmental restrictions on coking, sintering, pelletizing, which restricts blast furnace utilization and steel output \u2013 <strong>probable.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Downside risks to Q4 forecast<\/h3>\n<p>Harsher wintery weather conditions impede construction\/infrastructure projects and apparent steel consumption \u2013 <strong>possible.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Large volumes of Australian and Brazilian iron ore supply continue to land in China resulting in significant decline hot metal production costs - <strong>probable.<\/strong><\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Steel: What's happened to Chinese steel consumption in 2020?
