In this thought piece below, we list what we believe will be the most pertinent key drivers for global ferrous markets in 2020:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Key China Macro Developments:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>In November, China\u2019s Ministry of Finance directed local authorities to speed up the issuance of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-economy-bonds\/china-front-loads-142-billion-in-2020-local-government-bonds-to-spur-growth-idUSKBN1Y113D\">RMB1 trillion ($145bn) in \u201cspecial\u201d government bonds<\/a><\/span>, aimed at supporting domestic construction and infrastructure projects that would stabilize the overall economy much earlier in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Beijing (central government) also announced that it intends to \u201cmaintain long and steady growth now and for years to come\u201d and keep growth \u201cwithin a reasonable range\u201d during a Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping, according to a post on the State Council\u2019s website in December.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC) announced it would <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/think.ing.com\/snaps\/china-rrr-cut-for-seasonal-loan-demand\/#:~:text=As%20expected%2C%20because%20of%20damage,is%20effective%20from%206%20January.\">cut the banks\u2019 reserve requirement ratio (RRR) by 50 basis points (0.50%)<\/a><\/span>, effective January 6, 2020; bringing the RRR level for large banks down to 12.5% while the ratio for smaller lenders would drop to 10.5%.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How will this impact China Ferrous Supply\/Demand Fundamentals?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>While <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-economy-rrr-cut\/china-cuts-banks-reserve-ratios-again-frees-up-115-billion-to-spur-economy-idUSKBN1Z01LA\">PBOC has dropped the RRR eight times since 2018<\/a><\/span> to free up more funds for banks to lend, the issuance of the aforementioned RMB1 trillion \u201cspecial\u201d bonds package will likely have a more profound effect on real domestic steel consumption (positively) as it filters through the economy from June\/July 2020 onwards \u2013 assuming a six-month lag at the earliest.<\/p>\n<p>Government\/stimulus-driven steel-intensive projects will lead to several material developments:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Higher domestic steel production to meet demand, specifically long products (incl. semis).<\/li>\n<li>Increased consumption of raw materials, specifically iron ore and met. coal\/coke.<\/li>\n<li>Relatively lower steel exports, specifically long products (incl. semis) to the Rest of the World.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Robust Chinese steel consumption on its own (excl. AD duties\/tariffs) should be sufficient to reduce volumes of billet, bar, and rod available to export markets. Anecdotally, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-economy-trade\/china-november-exports-fall-but-import-growth-hints-of-recovering-demand-idUSKBN1YC02H\">Chinese steel exports in November totalled 4.57mn mt<\/a><\/span> of which steel bars (billet, rebar, rod) accounted for only 600,000 mt (13%) compared with 4.87mn mt (44.5%) in June 2016. This has been a long-run trend.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is the Outlook for Ferrous Markets (ex. China) in 2020?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The absence or lack of influence of significant Chinese (longs) steel export volumes should enable regional steel and raw materials market fundamentals to play out unencumbered through the Rest of the World; with the main barrier to \u201cfree trade\u201d (ex. China) being tariffs, quotas, and AD duties.<\/p>\n<p>Chinese government\/stimulus-driven steel-intensive projects will drive demand for steel, domestic output and raw materials consumption. Therefore, relatively healthier steel prices\/margins and demand for raw materials should provide some buoyancy to iron ore and metallurgical coal prices (major hot metal production costs) in particular.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, medium-term ferrous pricing dynamics will likely be dictated by the competitiveness between regional EAF (ferrous scrap) vs. BOF (hot metal) production costs. Should robust Chinese demand for virgin iron units eventuate, hot metal production costs could provide some support to ferrous scrap suppliers in pushing their prices higher.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Risks to Hypothesis:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Vale\/Samarco (Brazil) returns a material portion of its displaced iron ore production volumes earlier than expected (earmarked for the end of 2020\/early 2021) removing substantial support from iron ore pricing levels and hot metal production costs \u2013 <strong>unlikely<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Chinese stimulus-driven steel-intensive projects do not affect real steel consumption to the expected extent and\/or time horizons as stated above; pushing out steel demand\/production and steel-making raw materials consumption to later in the year or early 2021 \u2013 <strong>possible<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>Key ferrous metals consuming and\/or importing nations (e.g. US, Turkey, Europe, Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia) witness a material decline in steel demand in 2020; negatively affecting local steel production and raw materials consumption in those regions\/markets \u2013 <strong>unlikely<\/strong>.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; One of the recurring questions posed by market participants in recent meetings over the winter holiday period has been \u201cwhat role will China play in the global steel and ferrous scrap markets in 2020?\u201d.
