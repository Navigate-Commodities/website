VAT) in mid-August compared with RMB45\/t for BF-EAF and an RMB26\/t for scrap-intensive EAFs on the same basis.<\/p>\n<p>Since Q2 2017, Chinese integrated steel producers significantly increased their ferrous-scrap usage in basic oxygen steelmaking due to induction furnace closures which created a temporary, but substantial reservoir (c.50-70Mt) of relatively cheap iron units.<\/p>\n<p>While China\u2019s technical BOF scrap usage rates have not yet peaked, they reached an economic tolerance of 189\/kg per tonne of liquid steel (kg\/tls) in 2019, from 157kt\/tls the previous year, given the trade-off between availability and cost competitiveness.<\/p>\n<p>More recently, Tangshan (China\u2019s key steelmaking hub) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-economy-output-steel\/china-produces-record-crude-steel-in-july-on-strong-demand-idUSKCN25A0EP\">blast furnace capacity utilization rates have soared to 88% in early August<\/a><\/span> from the recent low of 69% at the end of February in response to the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.straitstimes.com\/asia\/east-asia\/chinas-v-shaped-economic-recovery-just-started-experts\">post-COVID-19 V-shaped recovery in steel consumption<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, material increases in BOF output and relative scrap use, given its sheer scale, has created a significant tightness in ferrous scrap supply and inflated domestic prices, disadvantaging those local scrap-dependent electric arc furnaces.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Is there any room for Chinese EAFs to manoeuvre?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>With Chinese BF-BOFs running at close to full capacity utilization, the scope of further ferrous scrap consumption growth will be relatively limited via this steelmaking process.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, we expect robust basic oxygen furnace steel production and underlying scrap consumption will keep domestic ferrous scrap prices relatively high.<\/p>\n<p>Based on current market fundamentals, we believe that Tangshan ferrous scrap benchmarks have almost peaked at RMB2,915\/t (incl. VAT) while any downside risk is unlikely.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, Chinese scrap-intensive electric arc furnaces will require a marked improvement in domestic rebar consumption, prices, and margins to support any increase in output.<\/p>\n<p>We forecast that this base-case scenario will likely eventuate once <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/070a5dbb-5832-41fc-ae0c-bd2dfb5da039\">heavy rains and resulting floods subside<\/a><\/span>, enabling <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/navigatecommodities.com\/stimulus-converts-china-into-net-steel-importer\/\">stimulus-driven construction steel consumption growth<\/a><\/span> to resume.<\/p>\n<p>The highest risk to the competitiveness Chinese scrap-fed EAFs versus BF-BOFs is our medium-term outlook for weaker iron ore prices, which will significantly lower hot metal production costs.<\/p>\n<p>Those hybrid electric arc furnaces able to consume a mixture of hot metal and scrap will likely alter their charge towards molten iron-use to improve their cost competitiveness.<\/p>\n<p>We do not foresee any material increase in domestic ferrous scrap generation in the short to medium term, as China carries out its long-run development of the recycling industry.<\/p>\n<p>One potential release valve for EAFs would be the reclassification and removal of low ferrous scrap import quotas, permitting some mills to subsidize high input costs with highly competitive imports.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Why are China's electric arc furnaces struggling?
