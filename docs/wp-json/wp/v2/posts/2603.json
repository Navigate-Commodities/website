prices have plunged 34.8% from a recent peak of $164\/t, fob Australia, in early March to a trough of $107\/t in early May.<\/p>\n<p>Australia, the world\u2019s largest seaborne metallurgical coal supplier, posted quarter-on-quarter declines in met coal shipments of 7.2% in Q1 and 2.1% in Q2 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Demand for metallurgical coal, particularly Australian-origin material, has been decimated by sharp COVID-19-related contractions in blast furnace output in Europe, India, Japan, and South Korea.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>When the Rest of the World steps back, China steps up<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>One saving grace for Australian metallurgical coal producers has been the emergence of China\u2019s insatiable appetite for seaborne cargoes in the second quarter of 2020.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.scmp.com\/economy\/china-economy\/article\/3095211\/australia-becomes-chinas-top-source-coking-coal-stimulus\">Australian metallurgical coal exports to China surged 49.5%<\/a><\/span> quarter-on-quarter to record highs of 15.8Mt in Q2 2020 compared with 10.6Mt the previous quarter.<\/p>\n<p>This has partly been driven by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.xinhuanet.com\/english\/2020-08\/04\/c_139263767.htm\">reduced Mongolian supply availability after the country closed its border with China in March<\/a><\/span> which saw volumes drop to an 11-year low of 292kt in March.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Chinese anticipation of a sharp rebound in steel and blast furnace output, as well as the substantial arbitrage between domestic versus seaborne supply has also driven bookings.<\/p>\n<p>In early August, the cost of customs-cleared premium hard coking coal currently stands at $134\/t (incl. 13% VAT) versus $187\/t for equivalent domestic grades.<\/p>\n<p>The significant arbitrage for Chinese buyers has also triggered opportunistic purchasing activity, despite the imposition of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/6142f1b9-58cc-47e4-b2fb-8212ad792b2d\">opaque import quotas to support the domestic coal industry<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>How have Chinese import quotas affected trade?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>China introduced import restrictions and quotas in 2018 in a bid to shield domestic markets from volatile swings in major seaborne benchmarks.<\/p>\n<p>Since that time, importers have front-loaded their purchases through the first three quarters of each year to avoid failing to clear customs once the allotted quotas dry up.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, front-loading has become more prevalent in response to significantly longer <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-china-coal-imports\/china-curbs-coal-imports-after-5-months-of-record-inflows-sources-idUSKBN23I1QD\">customs clearance times of up to 90 days<\/a><\/span> in some instances.<\/p>\n<p>For those buyers that fail to clear customs when the import quota runs out, many have had to hold their material at port or sea to be declared the following calendar year.<\/p>\n<p>In this tripartite system of domestic versus Australian versus Mongolia supply, Beijing has acted as a \u201cfine tuner\u201d for local markets given that imports account for only a fraction of overall consumption.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Where do metallurgical coal markets go from here?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The effects of a severe demand contraction from major metallurgical coal consuming nations have been partially offset by Chinese buyers front-loading their bookings and taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, we estimate that the pace of supply cuts and disruptions in key producing and exporting nations, particularly Australia, Canada, Mongolia, Russia, and the US, is now relatively well-balanced with that of global seaborne demand.<\/p>\n<p>We expect seaborne metallurgical coal markets to fall into a modest deficit in the third quarter as Chinese traders import greater volumes before quotas drying up, returning to a modest surplus in Q4 as Chinese buyers pull out of the market.<\/p>\n<p>We then forecast that prices will recover to $145\/t, fob Australia, in Q1 2021 as developed and emerging markets shake off the shackles of COVID-19 relation disruptions with expansive stimulus packages feeding through to steel-intensive (construction &amp; infrastructure) projects.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Turbulent times for the metallurgical coal markets Major seaborne metallurgical premium hard coking coal prices have plunged 34.8% from a
