The technical part (A)\u2026<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Iron ore lumps have a great diversity in physical properties, which can give the material poorer reduction-degradation and reducibility properties as a considerable variation in shape and size does not facilitate gas permeability and an even descent of the burden.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, lumps with larger surface areas and non-porous-like structures have higher melting temperatures and, as a result, require increased fuel rates (metallurgical coke) to achieve the necessary heat for the reaction.<\/p>\n<p>While iron ore lump typically contains a higher iron content compared with most medium-grade fines, the deleterious aspects of using this direct shipping ore (DSO) outweigh the modest iron-bearing benefits when operating blast furnaces at high utilization rates.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, blast furnace pellets offer a greater value proposition for Chinese mills due to rock-bottom premiums, significantly higher iron content, proportionally lower acidic impurities, higher porosity, lower melting temperatures and homogeneous sizes.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What is holding back Chinese mills?
