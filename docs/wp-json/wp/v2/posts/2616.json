July).<\/p>\n<p>Turkish HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20) import prices have since jumped 11.8% from a more recent higher-low of $254\/t, cfr Turkey, in late June to the current peak of $284\/t in early August.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>If Iron Ore is wrong, what is right?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Pricing dynamics in commodity markets hardly ever follow a perfectly linear trend given their transactional nature and the impact of supply &amp; demand imbalances.<\/p>\n<p>Pre-Q1 2019, we typically would have weighted our ferrous scrap price forecast to the long-run relationship with 62% iron ore prices normalized for Fe content.<\/p>\n<p>However, the Pearson correlation coefficient between ferrous scrap and iron ore has dwindled from a relatively robust 0.66 in January 2019 to a paltry 0.33 in August 2020.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, the short to medium term directional relationship between the two partially indirectly substitutable bulk ferrous commodities are no longer defensible as a standalone indicator.<\/p>\n<p>If we turn attention to the relationship between ferrous scrap and hot metal production costs, there is still a high degree of correlation at 0.60 compared with 0.70 in January 2019.<\/p>\n<p>Amusingly one of the main determinants of hot metal production costs is iron ore, given that you typically require 1.5 tonnes of ore, and only 0.6 tonnes of fuel (coke), to produce one tonne of hot metal.<\/p>\n<p>What these factors tell us is that volatility in iron ore prices, since Vale's iron ore tailings dam disaster in January 2019, has made it an unreliable short-term lead indicator for scrap benchmarks.<\/p>\n<p>But when comparing scrap with iron ore as a function of hot metal production costs, the medium- to longer-term relationship remains relatively robust given that scrap is used as a residual metallics component in global, predominantly BOF, steelmaking.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Do we expect a scrappy recovery?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Based on current domestic rebar prices, we calculate that Turkish rebar producers could accommodate up to a $25\/t increase in ferrous scrap costs before reaching their limit on production costs.<\/p>\n<p>This mechanism has already started to flex with major Turkish steel producers raising their domestic rebar benchmarks by more than $15\/t to $525\/t (incl. VAT) in early August to incorporate recent ferrous scrap price hikes and in anticipation of more to come.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, we forecast that Turkish HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20) ferrous scrap benchmarks can climb up to $310\/t in the short-to-medium term (months rather than weeks) based on current pricing dynamics and the recovery in market fundamentals.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, Turkey's consumption of construction-grade steel will continue to be fuelled by its <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/asiatimes.com\/2020\/08\/erdogans-mega-projects-will-end-up-choking-istanbul\/\">\"mega-projects\"<\/a><\/span>, which include the expansion of Istanbul's <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailysabah.com\/tourism\/2020\/01\/01\/state-of-art-istanbul-airport-to-display-aviation-hub-potential-in-2020\">newest airport<\/a><\/span>, construction of the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-turkey-canal\/turkey-holds-first-tender-related-to-istanbul-canal-project-idUSKBN21D1WY\">Istanbul Canal<\/a><\/span>, and the reconstruction of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-turkey-canal\/turkey-holds-first-tender-related-to-istanbul-canal-project-idUSKBN21D1WY\">bridges over the Bosphorus<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>On that basis, we calculate that Turkish HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20) import prices could climb as high as $325\/t in the medium term as construction and infrastructure projects fuel steel and underlying ferrous scrap consumption.<\/p>\n<p>We expect scrap benchmarks to reach those levels in the next couple of quarters rather than months, given that it would be too much of an adjustment for mills and end users to digest sooner, needing enough runway to incorporate higher costs into their finished steel prices.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Turkish Q2 ferrous scrap trade deteriorates Turkish HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20) ferrous scrap import prices declined 32.3% from a pre-COVID-19 high of $303\/t, cfr Turkey, in late December 2019 to a recent COVID-19-afflicted low of $205\/t in late March.
