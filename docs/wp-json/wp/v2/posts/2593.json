deliver the much talked about \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery in most major European economies over the past couple of months.<\/p>\n<p>Governments have had to make the unpalatable decision of getting the wheels of their respective economies turning while trading-off the consequential longer-term impacts on the environment.<\/p>\n<p>Stimulus packages announced by major EU countries will alleviate some pressure, although incentives will have a limited effect on structural medium to long-term vehicle sales.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, incentivized vehicle purchases have indeed provided an adrenaline boost, albeit temporarily, to the engine room of manufacturing activity.<\/p>\n<p>After two months\u2019 worth of new vehicle registration figures, a distinct picture is being painted of the impact scrappage incentive schemes have had on purchases of automobiles.<\/p>\n<p>There is no doubt that recent car sales figures are a function of released pent up demand, after the relaxation of lockdown restrictions, and vehicle purchase schemes.<\/p>\n<p>Almost all automobile associations and ministerial transportation departments report the performance of their respective automotive sectors on an annual like-for-like basis.<\/p>\n<p>Seasonality, however, is relatively meaningless when market drivers have changed, with consumption fuelled by unilateral incentives to encourage part-exchanging to new(er) electric vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>In countries where sales incentives and scrappage schemes have been implemented early (June) and have run their course by July, new registration figures look ominous for the road ahead.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What do the latest European new car sales figures look like for July?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>For example, French car sales suggest that pent up demand and sales incentivized by a government scrappage scheme, which ended on July 31, have now begun to fizzle out.<\/p>\n<p>The French Automobile Manufacturers Committee (CCFA) pointed to <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.autotimesnews.com\/the-french-car-market-returned-to-growth-due-to-state-support-programs\/\">3.9% year-on-year sales growth in July<\/a><\/span> but stopped short at highlighting the 23.5% fall from the previous month when the incentive scheme\u2019s quota was almost fully utilized.<\/p>\n<p>In Spain, meanwhile, the automotive sector is currently benefitting from the government\u2019s \u20ac3.75bn ($4.2bn) stimulus package and a reduction in Value Added Tax (VAT).<\/p>\n<p>That said, stimulus-driven <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-spain-economy-pmi\/spanish-factory-activity-grows-in-july-after-long-lockdown-car-sales-up-idUSKBN24Z0PI\">car sales in Spain were only 1.1% higher in July<\/a><\/span> compared with the same month a year earlier in a period without intensive targeted incentives.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Italy, where the government was comparatively late in passing its incentive scheme, has likely witnessed the most transparent picture of where real consumption truly stands.<\/p>\n<p>While Italy\u2019s monthly new car sales appear to have levelled off at 130,000-140,000 units in June and July, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/uk.reuters.com\/article\/uk-italy-car-registrations\/italy-new-car-sales-fall-11-in-july-idUKKCN24Z258\">sales still stand 11% lower on a year-on-year<\/a> <\/span>basis.<\/p>\n<p>These sales volumes will likely be short-lived given that the Italian government recently announced that their <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-health-coronavirus-italy-automotive\/italy-to-introduce-subsidies-to-combustion-engine-cars-to-help-industry-lawmakers-idUSKBN2442HN\">automotive sector support package would run from August to December<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Thereafter, however, we anticipate that pent up demand and incentivized sales across Europe will eventually run out of steam, while several other factors will also undermine long-run sales figures.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What does the Long-Run recovery in European <\/strong><strong>vehicle sales\u00a0<\/strong><strong>look like?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Consumer confidence is inextricably linked to employment levels, and with unemployment rates unlikely to materially recover for several quarters, purchases of big-ticket items will remain constrained.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, business and commercial vehicle sales will likely be a drag on headline figures, given heavily-reduced rentals from a decimated tourism industry exacerbated by a structural shift in \u201cworking from home\u201d culture on corporate lease-hire fleets.<\/p>\n<p>European countries that are less reliant on the automotive industry are unlikely to prolong or expand existing packages, while other sectors, such as tourism and transportation, will have to share state aid with the automobile industry.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, we expect the profusely talked about \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery of European automotive and manufacturing industries to transform into a \u201cW-shaped\u201d recovery with an obtusely pronounced second leg recovery through 2021 and beyond.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Vehicle sales incentives mask real EU demand Unilateral vehicle sales incentive schemes have helped deliver the
