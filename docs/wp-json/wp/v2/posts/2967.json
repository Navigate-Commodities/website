81.3% of which originated from Japan and 6.7% from the USA.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What are the similarities between the Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>During the last black swan event, decimated global steel consumption &amp; production (ex-China) resulted in the availability of large volumes of secondary raw materials and semi-finished steel.<\/p>\n<p>With China mostly unscathed by the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), traders were relatively well-positioned to benefit from the material arbitrage opportunities for these cargoes.<\/p>\n<p>At the peak of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, China imported 13.7Mt of ferrous scrap, 3.6Mt of merchant pig iron, 1.8Mt of DRI\/HBI, and 3.7Mt of steel billets.<\/p>\n<p>While there are some nuances between the GFC and COVID-19 years, the material impact on trade flows has not been too dissimilar.<\/p>\n<p>According to the latest trade data (September 2020), China has so far imported 12.7Mt of steel billets, 3.9Mt of merchant pig iron, and 2.6Mt of DRI\/HBI through 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Chinese buyers and traders have procured significantly greater volumes of steel billets in the absence of eligible ferrous scrap imports.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Who are the likely \u201cWinners\u201d?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Without doubt, major Japanese ferrous scrap exporters would benefit from the easing of restrictions given its proximity to China and the significant arbitrage that currently exists.<\/p>\n<p>Based on the latest domestic data, Chinese Heavy Melt Scrap #1 prices traded at around CNY2,900\/t or US$439\/t (incl. 13% VAT) delivered to mill basis in early November.<\/p>\n<p>We estimate equivalent Japanese-origin scrap grades cleared through Chinese customs would be priced at CNY2,274\/t or US$344\/t on the same basis.<\/p>\n<p>This would create a hypothetical arbitrage of approximately CNY628\/t or US$95\/t.<\/p>\n<p>While US-origin material is presently priced at almost parity to Japanese scrap on a FOB basis, we calculate costlier freight rates put US material at a US$10\/mt disadvantage.<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, significant arbitrage opportunities would exist to make even some north European origin (UK, Germany, and the Netherlands) viable.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Who are the potential \u201cLosers\u201d?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Should China\u2019s ferrous scrap import restrictions be loosened next year, we would expect a large proportion of steel billet imports to be displaced.<\/p>\n<p>China imported 2.7Mt, 2.4Mt, and 1.6Mt of Russian, Indian and Vietnamese-origin billet respectively through the first nine months of 2020.<\/p>\n<p>We believe Chinese mills would most likely import cost-competitive ferrous scrap to meet their melting requirements and produce their own billets.<\/p>\n<p>Buyers will be incentivized to cut out the \u201cmiddleman\u201d of billet supply and procure ferrous scrap from the same exporters (Japan, USA, UK) shipping to Indian and Vietnamese steel producers.<\/p>\n<p>While not all Russian-origin billet will be substituted, scrap exporters there would become eligible to compete with their semi-finished steel comrades.<\/p>\n<p>The \u201cWinners\u201d are unlikely to change come this time next year, thought the potential \u201cLosers\u201d may see some variances based on the competitiveness of their input costs.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Risks to \u201cWinners\u201d:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Protracted delays in implementing recategorization of China\u2019s ferrous scrap imports will result in slower substitution away from billet.<\/li>\n<li>Expeditious recovery in ex-China steel output and ferrous scrap demand could trade away arbitrage sooner.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Risks to \u201cLosers\u201d:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Swift implementation of China\u2019s ferrous scrap import recategorization will substitute billet imports quicker.<\/li>\n<li>Prolonged recovery in ex-China steel output and ferrous scrap consumption will sustain material arbitrage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ferrous Scrap: Winners &amp;
