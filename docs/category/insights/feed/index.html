										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Ferrous Scrap: Winners &amp; Losers if China lifts import ban</strong></h3>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.recyclingtoday.com/article/china-steel-stainless-ferrous-scrap-recycling-import-standards-draft/">recategorization of China’s ferrous scrap imports</a> into closer alignment with domestic specifications should see import restrictions lifted by mid-to-late next year.</p>
<p>Following the release of these <a href="https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2156191-china-seeks-comment-on-imported-steel-scrap-standards">draft guidelines on China’s iron and steel scrap import classifications</a>, we take a closer look at the potential “Winners” and “Losers” of import substitution opportunities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Who was affected by the original ferrous scrap import ban?</strong></h3>
<p>China introduced restrictions on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-metals-scrap-factbox-idUSKCN1TT07R">scrap metal imports from 1st July 2019</a>, after Beijing had informed the World Trade Organization (WTO) two years earlier it would ban arrivals of solid waste.</p>
<p>Since that time, Chinese ferrous scrap import volumes have virtually fallen to zero as sweeping restrictions have taken no prisoners – despite ferrous scrap’s “green” recyclable reputation.</p>
<p>In the five years prior, China imported an average of 2.14Mt of ferrous scrap per annum; 81.3% of which originated from Japan and 6.7% from the USA.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>What are the similarities between the Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19?</strong></h3>
<p>During the last black swan event, decimated global steel consumption &amp; production (ex-China) resulted in the availability of large volumes of secondary raw materials and semi-finished steel.</p>
<p>With China mostly unscathed by the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), traders were relatively well-positioned to benefit from the material arbitrage opportunities for these cargoes.</p>
<p>At the peak of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2009, China imported 13.7Mt of ferrous scrap, 3.6Mt of merchant pig iron, 1.8Mt of DRI/HBI, and 3.7Mt of steel billets.</p>
<p>While there are some nuances between the GFC and COVID-19 years, the material impact on trade flows has not been too dissimilar.</p>
<p>According to the latest trade data (September 2020), China has so far imported 12.7Mt of steel billets, 3.9Mt of merchant pig iron, and 2.6Mt of DRI/HBI through 2020.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Chinese buyers and traders have procured significantly greater volumes of steel billets in the absence of eligible ferrous scrap imports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Who are the likely “Winners”?</strong></h3>
<p>Without doubt, major Japanese ferrous scrap exporters would benefit from the easing of restrictions given its proximity to China and the significant arbitrage that currently exists.</p>
<p>Based on the latest domestic data, Chinese Heavy Melt Scrap #1 prices traded at around CNY2,900/t or US$439/t (incl. 13% VAT) delivered to mill basis in early November.</p>
<p>We estimate equivalent Japanese-origin scrap grades cleared through Chinese customs would be priced at CNY2,274/t or US$344/t on the same basis.</p>
<p>This would create a hypothetical arbitrage of approximately CNY628/t or US$95/t.</p>
<p>While US-origin material is presently priced at almost parity to Japanese scrap on a FOB basis, we calculate costlier freight rates put US material at a US$10/mt disadvantage.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, significant arbitrage opportunities would exist to make even some north European origin (UK, Germany, and the Netherlands) viable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Who are the potential “Losers”?</strong></h3>
<p>Should China’s ferrous scrap import restrictions be loosened next year, we would expect a large proportion of steel billet imports to be displaced.</p>
<p>China imported 2.7Mt, 2.4Mt, and 1.6Mt of Russian, Indian and Vietnamese-origin billet respectively through the first nine months of 2020.</p>
<p>We believe Chinese mills would most likely import cost-competitive ferrous scrap to meet their melting requirements and produce their own billets.</p>
<p>Buyers will be incentivized to cut out the “middleman” of billet supply and procure ferrous scrap from the same exporters (Japan, USA, UK) shipping to Indian and Vietnamese steel producers.</p>
<p>While not all Russian-origin billet will be substituted, scrap exporters there would become eligible to compete with their semi-finished steel comrades.</p>
<p>The “Winners” are unlikely to change come this time next year, thought the potential “Losers” may see some variances based on the competitiveness of their input costs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Risks to “Winners”:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Protracted delays in implementing recategorization of China’s ferrous scrap imports will result in slower substitution away from billet.</li>
<li>Expeditious recovery in ex-China steel output and ferrous scrap demand could trade away arbitrage sooner.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Risks to “Losers”:</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Swift implementation of China’s ferrous scrap import recategorization will substitute billet imports quicker.</li>
<li>Prolonged recovery in ex-China steel output and ferrous scrap consumption will sustain material arbitrage.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Steel: What's happened to Chinese steel consumption in 2020?</strong></h3>
<p>In this analytical piece, we explore the developments in Chinese steel consumption during the first three quarters of 2020 before defining our outlook for Q4.</p>
<p>More specifically, we deep dive into China's steel rebar industry as a strong and reflective barometer on the health of the overall Chinese economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Quarter 1: The Plague</strong></h3>
<p>Traditionally, Chinese warehouses, wholesalers, and traders build inventories of finished steel (rebar, hot-rolled coil etc…) through the first three months of the year.</p>
<p>The rationale is to stockpile in preparation for the perennial peak in Chinese steel consumption during the second and third quarters.</p>
<p>In December ‘19 local stockists across 35 cities started rebuilding rebar inventories from a multi-year low of 2.9Mt.</p>
<p>While restocking was in full swing for the year ahead, COVID-19 related lockdowns and restrictions on movement enforced from late-January to late-March/early-April.</p>
<p>With an estimated 233.5 million people afflicted by restrictions on movement, Chinese steel consumption was impeded for 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p>This exacerbated the build-up of rebar stockpiles which surged to a record high of 14.3Mt in mid-March; increasing 41.6% compared with the peak of 10.2Mt in March 2019.</p>
<p>As a result, domestic rebar producers responded to decimated demand by making mass production cuts during this period.</p>
<p>Rebar production rates were slashed 33.3% from 3.6Mt per week (187Mt annualized) in December to a three-year low of 2.4Mt per week (125Mt annualized) in March.</p>
<p>That said, we calculate less than half of those production cuts (0.5Mt per week or 26Mt annualized) were a result of Lunar New Year vacations from January 25th.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Quarter 2: The Floods</strong></h3>
<p>With China emerging from lockdown in late-March/early-April, the resumption of construction and infrastructure projects started to release pent-up steel consumption.</p>
<p>Demand was so robust through Q2 that rebar producers were able to ramp up output to record levels without hampering a significant drawdown in national inventories.</p>
<p>Rebar production rates surged 66.7% from the March lows (2.4Mt) to record highs of 4.0Mt per week (208Mt annualized) in late-June; 5.0% higher compared with the June 2019 peak.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, daily construction steel trading volumes peaked at a record 309,000 tonnes per day (113Mt annualized) in mid-May.</p>
<p>As a result, national rebar inventories declined 47.0% to 7.6Mt in mid-to-late June from the 14.3Mt peak in mid-March.</p>
<p>We estimate this demand strength was partly driven by the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-bonds/china-front-loads-142-billion-in-2020-local-government-bonds-to-spur-growth-idUSKBN1Y113D">front-loading of a pre-COVID-19 RMB1 trillion (US$142bn) special bond issuance</a></span> announced in November last year.</p>
<p>China’s finance ministry stated that local governments must ensure that special-purpose bonds be issued and used as early as possible to avoid a sharp economic slowdown.</p>
<p>That said, the pace of the post-COVID-19 steel demand recovery had little time to reach full stride given the onset of seasonal rains, resulting in large-scale floods across the country in late May.</p>
<p>Such were the extremes of the rains and floods that approximately 63.5 million were affected, causing a direct economic loss of US$29 billion.</p>
<p>As a result, daily construction steel trading volumes plunged 41.3% from their post-COVID-19 high to 181,000 tonnes per day (66Mt annualized) in early-June.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Quarter 3: The Rod of Indiscipline</strong></h3>
<p>We calculate that floods slowed apparent consumption growth of long products from a peak of 7% year-on-year in May to a post-COVID-19-low of 5% in July.</p>
<p>While adverse weather conditions hampered long steel demand growth, mills exercised less discipline with rebar production rates.</p>
<p>Rebar production rates only declined by 7.5% from 4.0Mt per week (208Mt annualized) in late-June to 3.7Mt per week (192Mt annualized) in late-September.</p>
<p>This resulted in a 17% or 1.3Mt increase in national rebar inventories from 7.6Mt (June) to 8.9Mt (September) over this period.</p>
<p>With receding floodwater, construction steel trading volumes have rebounded from recent lows and apparent consumption growth has crept up to 6% year-on-year in September.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Quarter 4: The Outlook</strong></h3>
<p>We anticipate Chinese construction steel demand, particularly for rebar, will remain seasonably robust through October and November.</p>
<p>Most end-users will likely drawdown rebar from warehouses rather than procure freshly rolled material, as stockists cut prices to deplete relatively high inventories before the year-end.</p>
<p>With mills scaling back output and “social” inventories declining over this period, this will limit the scope of declines in domestic billet and rebar prices.</p>
<p>Additional downside risk will be lower hot metal production costs, driven by iron ore, which will remove a modicum of some support from finished steel prices.</p>
<p>That said, we expect hot metal/<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://navigatecommodities.com/iron-ore-what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting/">iron ore to decline at a faster pace</a></span> than billet &amp; rebar, resulting in a recovery in steel margins in the process.</p>
<p>At the same time, more competitive domestic semi- and finished-steel prices (and higher import prices) will narrow the arbitrage opportunity for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://navigatecommodities.com/stimulus-converts-china-into-net-steel-importer/">foreign suppliers to export to China</a></span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, we anticipate China will reclaim its status as a net exporter of steel within the next three months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Upside risks to Q4 forecast</h3>
<p>Rest of the World blast furnace production, iron ore consumption &amp; costs rebound sharply, pressuring Chinese steel prices higher – <strong>possible.</strong></p>
<p>Intermittent environmental restrictions on coking, sintering, pelletizing, which restricts blast furnace utilization and steel output – <strong>probable.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Downside risks to Q4 forecast</h3>
<p>Harsher wintery weather conditions impede construction/infrastructure projects and apparent steel consumption – <strong>possible.</strong></p>
<p>Large volumes of Australian and Brazilian iron ore supply continue to land in China resulting in significant decline hot metal production costs - <strong>probable.</strong></p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com/whats-happened-to-chinese-steel-consumption-in-2020/">Steel: What&#039;s happened to Chinese steel consumption in 2020?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com">Navigate Commodities</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>What to expect when you're expecting</strong></h3>
<p>Iron ore markets have been in a tug of war between speculative retail investors on the DCE, which have driven physical prices higher, versus fundamentals displaying increasing downside risks.</p>
<p>Seaborne 62% iron ore fines benchmarks have now been rangebound between $120-130/t, cfr China, for the past six weeks.</p>
<p>Prices tested the upper boundary on two occasions in the past two weeks – September 3rd and 14th – and the lower range on September 17th.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/091620-chinas-property-infrastructure-growth-rises-in-august-supporting-metals-demand"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Construction</span> data</a> (e.g. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-09/19/c_139380906.htm">excavator sales</a></span>), <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/china-stimulus-covid19-economic-recovery/">injection of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fiscal stimulus</span></a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/07/business/china-xi-economy.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bullish comments</span> from the Chinese government</a> have helped support sentiment-driven futures rallies.</p>
<p>More recently, however, strong iron ore supply fundamentals have partially counterbalanced and capped these rallies over this period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Iron ore supply fundamentals supercharged in Q3</strong></h3>
<p>Brazilian iron ore shipments have now returned to pre-COVID-19 run rates of 8.7Mt per week on August 30th, though still 11.1% below the pre-Brumadinho peak of 9.82Mt in Sept ‘18.</p>
<p>Despite COVID-19-related disruptions to shipments in April, <a href="https://navigatecommodities.com/south-china-morning-post-interview/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Australian consignments are up 2.78% year-to-date</span></a> with run rates currently standing at 16.39Mt.</p>
<p>Furthermore, relatively high prices have enabled some Chinese iron ore miners, typically at the high-end of the cost curve, to ramp up output to a current annualized rate of 196Mt.</p>
<p>To put this in context, Australian consignments, Brazilian shipments, and Chinese production were 3.3%, 33.3% and 3.7% higher respectively on a year-on-year basis in mid-September.</p>
<p>When combined Australian and Brazilian weekly iron ore despatches reached a record 21.6Mt (1.12bn annualized) at the end of August, 2.9% higher than the previous record in Sept ‘18.</p>
<p>More importantly, late-August shipment run rates were 42.7% higher (21.6Mt) compared with the pre-COVID-19 15.1Mt recorded in early January this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Chinese iron ore demand strong, but not strong enough</strong></h3>
<p>Chinese blast furnace iron (hot metal) output reached a new peak of 78.1Mt (938Mt annualized) in July 2020, 8.8% higher year-on-year.</p>
<p>At the same time, Rest of the World (ex-China) hot metal production has declined 16.3% to 31.9Mt (383Mt annualized) over the same period.</p>
<p>Now, if we compare pre-COVID-19 (Jan ‘20) and the latest blast furnace production rates (Jul ‘20) on an annualized basis we get a true sense of iron ore demand fundamentals.</p>
<p>We calculate that the increase in Chinese iron ore consumption (188Mt annualized) far exceeded the fall in Rest of the World (-123Mt annualized) over this period; indicating a 65Mt increase in demand.</p>
<p>That said, Australian and Brazilian shipments have increased by 289Mt on an annualized basis over this period (Jan-Jul); highlighting an annualized net surplus of 224Mt in this tripartite trade.</p>
<p>More recently, we estimate Chinese consumption has peaked close to July’s volumes in the past couple of months, while seaborne supply has continued to climb to record levels in August and September.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Expect the expected for Q4</strong></h3>
<p>Portside iron ore inventories will build over the next few weeks as large Australian and Brazilian shipments land in China while domestic consumption rates are unable to keep pace.</p>
<p>Chinese blast furnaces will only modestly scale back hot metal production in October through December as construction and infrastructure projects delayed by heavy rains and floods resume.</p>
<p>We fully expect end-users to work their way through relatively high steel inventories, the build-up of which had been exacerbated by high domestic production and flood-afflicted consumption.</p>
<p>Australian and Brazilian export volumes will react to reduced Chinese consumption during this period, but it will likely be a measured response given that Vale is recovering lost production.</p>
<p>The recovery in Rest of the World blast furnace iron output and underlying iron ore consumption rates has been pushed back to 2021 as uncertainties linger over sustainable steel demand.</p>
<p>Navigate Commodities calculates that the global iron ore market balance will transition to a net surplus of 56Mt in Q4 2020.</p>
<p>We forecast that this net surplus – ceteris paribus – should remove support from seaborne iron ore benchmarks to bring 62% fines prices down to <strong>US$90-100/t</strong>, cfr China, in Q4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Upside risks to Q4 forecast</strong></h3>
<p>Rest of the World steel blast furnace production and iron ore consumption recovers sharply – <strong>possible</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://navigatecommodities.com/stimulus-converts-china-into-net-steel-importer/">Chinese stimulus</a></span>, pent-up steel demand and strong steel prices prompt blast furnaces to maintain high utilization rates – <strong>probable</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Downside risks to Q4 forecast</strong></h3>

<p>Intermittent environmental restrictions on coking, sintering, pelletizing etc…which restricts blast furnace utilization – <strong>probable</strong></p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com/iron-ore-what-to-expect-when-youre-expecting/">Iron Ore: What to expect when you&#039;re expecting</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com">Navigate Commodities</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Why are China's electric arc furnaces struggling?</strong></h3>
<p>China’s scrap-intensive electric arc furnaces (EAF) capacity utilization rates surged from a record low of 10% during COVID-19 afflicted February to a recent reading of 58% in early August.</p>
<p>Over the same period, those Chinese EAFs that consume both hot metal and scrap witnessed a rebound from a modest low of 61% back up to 70% capacity utilization.</p>
<p>One major advantage of the scrap-fed electric arc furnaces steelmaking process is the ability to “switch off” production in response to a material downturn in steel consumption and margins.</p>
<p>That said, their major disadvantages have been the exposure to inflated ferrous scrap and temporary volatility in ultra-high-power graphite electrode costs over the past three years.</p>
<p>We calculate that Chinese scrap-fed EAF rebar producers suffered a loss of RMB270/t compared with BF-BOF profit margins of RMB184/t at the height of COVID-19 lockdown measures in February.</p>
<h3><strong>Diverging steelmaking economics between processes</strong></h3>
<p>Despite resurgent iron ore and stubbornly high metallurgical coke prices, Chinese blast furnace-basic oxygen (BF-BOF) steelmakers have maintained a relatively healthy degree of profitability compared with their EAF-based peers.</p>
<p>More recently, Navigate Commodities calculates Tangshan BF-BOF rebar margins stood at RMB234/t (incl. VAT) in mid-August compared with RMB45/t for BF-EAF and an RMB26/t for scrap-intensive EAFs on the same basis.</p>
<p>Since Q2 2017, Chinese integrated steel producers significantly increased their ferrous-scrap usage in basic oxygen steelmaking due to induction furnace closures which created a temporary, but substantial reservoir (c.50-70Mt) of relatively cheap iron units.</p>
<p>While China’s technical BOF scrap usage rates have not yet peaked, they reached an economic tolerance of 189/kg per tonne of liquid steel (kg/tls) in 2019, from 157kt/tls the previous year, given the trade-off between availability and cost competitiveness.</p>
<p>More recently, Tangshan (China’s key steelmaking hub) <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-economy-output-steel/china-produces-record-crude-steel-in-july-on-strong-demand-idUSKCN25A0EP">blast furnace capacity utilization rates have soared to 88% in early August</a></span> from the recent low of 69% at the end of February in response to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/chinas-v-shaped-economic-recovery-just-started-experts">post-COVID-19 V-shaped recovery in steel consumption</a></span>.</p>
<p>As a result, material increases in BOF output and relative scrap use, given its sheer scale, has created a significant tightness in ferrous scrap supply and inflated domestic prices, disadvantaging those local scrap-dependent electric arc furnaces.</p>
<h3><strong>Is there any room for Chinese EAFs to manoeuvre?</strong></h3>
<p>With Chinese BF-BOFs running at close to full capacity utilization, the scope of further ferrous scrap consumption growth will be relatively limited via this steelmaking process.</p>
<p>Moreover, we expect robust basic oxygen furnace steel production and underlying scrap consumption will keep domestic ferrous scrap prices relatively high.</p>
<p>Based on current market fundamentals, we believe that Tangshan ferrous scrap benchmarks have almost peaked at RMB2,915/t (incl. VAT) while any downside risk is unlikely.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chinese scrap-intensive electric arc furnaces will require a marked improvement in domestic rebar consumption, prices, and margins to support any increase in output.</p>
<p>We forecast that this base-case scenario will likely eventuate once <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/070a5dbb-5832-41fc-ae0c-bd2dfb5da039">heavy rains and resulting floods subside</a></span>, enabling <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://navigatecommodities.com/stimulus-converts-china-into-net-steel-importer/">stimulus-driven construction steel consumption growth</a></span> to resume.</p>
<p>The highest risk to the competitiveness Chinese scrap-fed EAFs versus BF-BOFs is our medium-term outlook for weaker iron ore prices, which will significantly lower hot metal production costs.</p>
<p>Those hybrid electric arc furnaces able to consume a mixture of hot metal and scrap will likely alter their charge towards molten iron-use to improve their cost competitiveness.</p>
<p>We do not foresee any material increase in domestic ferrous scrap generation in the short to medium term, as China carries out its long-run development of the recycling industry.</p>
<p>One potential release valve for EAFs would be the reclassification and removal of low ferrous scrap import quotas, permitting some mills to subsidize high input costs with highly competitive imports.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com/why-are-chinas-electric-arc-furnaces-struggling/">Why are China&#039;s electric arc furnaces struggling?</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com">Navigate Commodities</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>The disintegration of Iron Ore Lump Premiums</strong></h3>
<p>Seaborne iron ore lump premiums have fallen 91% to three-year lows of $0.03/dmtu, cfr China, in late July 2020, from a recent peak of $0.33/dmtu in early March.</p>
<p>Chinese traders have swept up large volumes of lump cargoes at ever-increasing discounts over the past four months in response to higher Australian output and slack demand from other countries.</p>
<p>Chinese iron ore lump imports have indeed jumped 15.2% on a quarterly basis to 52.1Mt in Q2 2020, with Australia supplying 80.5% of the material.</p>
<p>That said, the picture looks bleak when you get to one of China’s major iron ore discharge ports, with PB Lumps (PBL) trading at an RMB1/t discount to PB Fines (PBF) in Qingdao in early August.</p>
<p>PBL’s long-run premium over its sister product (PBF) typically averages RMB120/t but has seen sharp declines from a recent premium of RMB225/t in early February to parity/discount in August.</p>
<p>Despite robust Chinese iron ore lump imports and a pricing parity with major brands of iron ore fines, local mills have struggled with the economics of utilizing this material in their blast furnaces.</p>
<p>Navigate Commodities calculates that domestic blast furnace lump consumption has only increased 2.8Mt to 14.2Mt in July from 11.4Mt in March.</p>
<p>Constrained domestic consumption has, therefore, exacerbated an increase in China’s portside lump inventories, climbing to a record 25.5Mt at the end of July from 18.9Mt in late March.</p>
<p>Not to mention that mushrooming lump inventories will also have a negative impact (for suppliers) of further undermining prices of that product.</p>
<h3><strong>What is holding back Chinese mills? The technical part (A)…</strong></h3>
<p>Iron ore lumps have a great diversity in physical properties, which can give the material poorer reduction-degradation and reducibility properties as a considerable variation in shape and size does not facilitate gas permeability and an even descent of the burden.</p>
<p>Moreover, lumps with larger surface areas and non-porous-like structures have higher melting temperatures and, as a result, require increased fuel rates (metallurgical coke) to achieve the necessary heat for the reaction.</p>
<p>While iron ore lump typically contains a higher iron content compared with most medium-grade fines, the deleterious aspects of using this direct shipping ore (DSO) outweigh the modest iron-bearing benefits when operating blast furnaces at high utilization rates.</p>
<p>At the same time, blast furnace pellets offer a greater value proposition for Chinese mills due to rock-bottom premiums, significantly higher iron content, proportionally lower acidic impurities, higher porosity, lower melting temperatures and homogeneous sizes.</p>
<h3><strong>What is holding back Chinese mills? The market part (B)…</strong></h3>
<p>Blast furnaces based in Tangshan, China’s key steelmaking hub in Hebei province, raised their <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-trade-ironore/update-1-chinas-july-iron-ore-imports-hit-record-high-on-robust-demand-idUSL4N2F91C5">capacity utilization rates to 87.27% in July</a></span> compared with 72.05% in March in response to easing environmental restrictions, rebounding production and stimulus-driven steel consumption.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chinese integrated steel producers will no doubt be wanting to maximize their productivity and eke out efficiency gains for each tonne of hot metal produced by their blast furnaces to lower unit production costs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://in.reuters.com/article/asia-ironore/china-steelmaking-ingredients-futures-prices-rise-on-strong-demand-idINL4N2F50Q5">Low domestic steel margins and high metallurgical coke costs</a></span> are currently not conducive to incrementally increase the charge of iron ore lumps into the blast furnace burden, given it would require a proportionally higher coke and lower coal injection rate.</p>
<h3><strong>What will it take to revive iron ore lump prices?</strong></h3>
<p>Despite multi-year low premiums, Australian iron ore lump miners are unlikely to drastically change production schedules or guidance in response to short term pricing dynamics – no matter how unfavourable.</p>
<p>Instead, lump producers and traders with long exposure will be partially banking on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://navigatecommodities.com/stimulus-converts-china-into-net-steel-importer/">Chinese stimulus-driven steel consumption</a></span> improving domestic steel margins; resulting in some blast furnaces being able to accommodate a proportionally higher lump charge.</p>
<p>At the same time, easing environmental restrictions on Chinese coking plants has enabled most producers to ramp up coke production over the past four months with capacity utilization rates gradually creeping up to 80% in early August from 75% in late March.</p>
<p>While it will take some time for improved operating rates to service robust domestic coke consumption and, at the same time, replenish significantly depleted inventories, we expect metallurgical coke prices to ease in the coming months.</p>
<p>Relatively lower metallurgical coke costs would then provide the dual advantage of not only easing pressure on steel margins but also improve the Value-in-Use (VIU) of utilizing comparatively lower-performance ores in the blast furnace charge.</p>
<p>Based on historical burden data, an average Chinese blast furnace typically consumes no more than 13% of iron ore lump in their charge with current rates hovering just under 12% in early August and late July, potentially capping future consumption.</p>
<p>However, with lump premiums trading at historical lows and if steel margins and metallurgical coke costs permit, this may prompt a behavioural change amongst some mills with them challenging these parameters – but this is a more speculative forecast.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com/iron-ore-lump-the-disintegration-of-premiums/">Iron Ore Lump: the disintegration of premiums</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com">Navigate Commodities</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>South China Morning Post: Interview</strong></h3>
<p>In an interview with the South China Morning Post (SCMP) on 6<sup>th</sup> August, Navigate Commodities’ Atilla Widnell (AW), Co-Founder &amp; Managing Director, shared our insights on recent developments in the tripartite iron ore trading relationship between Australia, Brazil, and China.</p>
<p><strong>SCMP:</strong> “Brazilian miner <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3095851/brazilian-miner-vale-looks-satisfy-chinas-appetite-iron-ore">Vale this week docked its first skyscraper-sized ore ship</a></span> at one of China’s newest deep-water ports, is this a strong signal of China diversifying its sources of iron ore?”</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> “We would avoid reading too much into just one vessel or consignment with respect to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3096350/chinas-new-yantai-deep-water-port-receives-first-iron-ore">structural repositioning of global iron ore trading partnerships</a></span>, despite the current contentious Australian-Chinese political relationship.</p>
<p>In actuality, Brazil, which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus, has struggled to ramp up iron ore production and exports to pre-COVID-19 volumes – let alone anywhere near close to levels seen before the Vale tailings dam disaster in January 2019.</p>
<p>Brazilian iron ore exports have only climbed 8.4% on a quarterly basis to 75.6 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2020, though volumes still stand 21% below shipments recorded in the same quarter (Q2) in 2018 – pre-COVID-19 and pre-Vale disaster.</p>
<p>Brazilian iron ore shipments have no doubt increased in July and early August this year, but the point of highlighting previous quarters’ trade data is to show that they are well below traditional flows and even further away from a global repositioning in iron ore trade.</p>
<p>If we look at the comparative performance of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/global-economy/article/3095376/australian-miners-rio-tinto-and-fortescue-post-record-iron">Australian iron ore miners and exporters, they posted a quarterly increase of 17.1% to 230.6 million tonnes in the second quarter</a></span> – let those numbers sink in for a minute…</p>
<p>So, the fact of the matter is, Brazil has and is still struggling to recover lost market share to the Australian miners, who have grabbed the opportunity to feed the recent increase in Chinese appetite for iron ore.”</p>
<p><strong>SCMP:</strong> “Will iron prices push lower? Will that improve margins for Chinese steel mills and support increased steel production?”</p>
<p><strong>AW:</strong> "On that note, iron ore benchmarks remain skittish to any news of supply disruptions despite record volumes coming out of Australia.</p>
<p>Temporary blast furnace restrictions should theoretically restrict domestic steel production and iron ore consumption to a certain degree.</p>
<p>More recently, however, iron ore prices have reacted counterintuitively to news of Chinese blast furnace production restrictions and true impact on consumption.</p>
<p>Investors punt long on the respective Shanghai Futures Exchange rebar contracts on supply concerns, while non-sophisticated investors also pile into the DCE’s iron ore contract.</p>
<p>Robust price performance of the DCE iron ore derivatives contract then in turn feeds back into the physical market as traders adjust the price of their material to mark-to-market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, steel producers in general tend to prefer higher steel production costs given that their margin as a % of the steel price remains the same but the dollar or, in this case, yuan value increases.</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, we do not believe Chinese steel producers will be too worried rising about hot metal production costs, of which iron ore accounts for a large proportion.</p>
<p>This is largely due to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://navigatecommodities.com/stimulus-converts-china-into-net-steel-importer/">substantial stimulus packages and liquidity injected into the economy to counter the effects of COVID-19</a></span>, which will drive steel-intensive construction and infrastructure project for the next 2-3 years.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Turkish Q2 ferrous scrap trade deteriorates</strong></h3>
<p>Turkish HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20) ferrous scrap import prices declined 32.3% from a pre-COVID-19 high of $303/t, cfr Turkey, in late December 2019 to a recent COVID-19-afflicted low of $205/t in late March.</p>
<p>Turkey, the world’s largest buyer of seaborne ferrous scrap, posted quarter-on-quarter declines of 16.6% in ferrous scrap imports to 4.395Mt in the three months to June 2020.</p>
<p>Buyers scaled back their orders in response to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/turkey-crude-steel-production-at-135m-tons-in-jan-may/1895797">reduced steel output over this period</a></span>, as domestic lockdown measures, particularly in March, decimated construction and manufacturing activity.</p>
<p>Scrap-intensive Turkish electric arc furnace (EAF) steel output declined 30.5% and 29.9% year-on-year in April and May respectively. Steel produced via the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) route witnessed more modest declines of 17.2% and 16.0% respectively over the same period.</p>
<h3><strong>Supply always lags demand</strong></h3>
<p>This ferrous scrap demand shock was not just limited to the Turkish steel industry but replicated in almost every single steel-producing nation across the world.</p>
<p>That said, the demand shock was swiftly countered by a supply shock with volumes across the weighbridge rapidly dwindling as local merchants were locked down at home.</p>
<p>The few major bulk suppliers still permitted to operate in key generating and exporting nations, such as the UK, Europe, and the US, found themselves competing over significantly reduced volumes.</p>
<p>As such, resurgent dockside collection costs supported a rebound in Turkish HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20) prices from the lows of $205/t in late-March to $257/t, cfr Turkey, in mid-April.</p>
<h3><strong>V-shaped recovery on the cards for Q3</strong></h3>
<p>Since that time, Turkish <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/turkeys-industrial-output-rebounds-in-may-posts-174-monthly-rise">construction of buildings</a></span> rallied 18.3% month-on-month in May, while local <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/business/economy/turkeys-industrial-output-rebounds-in-may-posts-174-monthly-rise">civil engineering projects</a></span> surged 40.4% on the same basis in April.</p>
<p>As a result, Turkish mills have quickly ramped up crude steel output 23.2% month-on-month and 4.1% year-on-year to 2.8Mt in June to meet this resurgent domestic consumption.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Turkish ferrous scrap buyers were extremely active in procuring cargoes to meet accelerating domestic steel production over the past couple of months (June &amp; July).</p>
<p>Turkish HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20) import prices have since jumped 11.8% from a more recent higher-low of $254/t, cfr Turkey, in late June to the current peak of $284/t in early August.</p>
<h3><strong>If Iron Ore is wrong, what is right?</strong></h3>
<p>Pricing dynamics in commodity markets hardly ever follow a perfectly linear trend given their transactional nature and the impact of supply &amp; demand imbalances.</p>
<p>Pre-Q1 2019, we typically would have weighted our ferrous scrap price forecast to the long-run relationship with 62% iron ore prices normalized for Fe content.</p>
<p>However, the Pearson correlation coefficient between ferrous scrap and iron ore has dwindled from a relatively robust 0.66 in January 2019 to a paltry 0.33 in August 2020.</p>
<p>As a result, the short to medium term directional relationship between the two partially indirectly substitutable bulk ferrous commodities are no longer defensible as a standalone indicator.</p>
<p>If we turn attention to the relationship between ferrous scrap and hot metal production costs, there is still a high degree of correlation at 0.60 compared with 0.70 in January 2019.</p>
<p>Amusingly one of the main determinants of hot metal production costs is iron ore, given that you typically require 1.5 tonnes of ore, and only 0.6 tonnes of fuel (coke), to produce one tonne of hot metal.</p>
<p>What these factors tell us is that volatility in iron ore prices, since Vale's iron ore tailings dam disaster in January 2019, has made it an unreliable short-term lead indicator for scrap benchmarks.</p>
<p>But when comparing scrap with iron ore as a function of hot metal production costs, the medium- to longer-term relationship remains relatively robust given that scrap is used as a residual metallics component in global, predominantly BOF, steelmaking.</p>
<h3><strong>Do we expect a scrappy recovery?</strong></h3>
<p>Based on current domestic rebar prices, we calculate that Turkish rebar producers could accommodate up to a $25/t increase in ferrous scrap costs before reaching their limit on production costs.</p>
<p>This mechanism has already started to flex with major Turkish steel producers raising their domestic rebar benchmarks by more than $15/t to $525/t (incl. VAT) in early August to incorporate recent ferrous scrap price hikes and in anticipation of more to come.</p>
<p>Therefore, we forecast that Turkish HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20) ferrous scrap benchmarks can climb up to $310/t in the short-to-medium term (months rather than weeks) based on current pricing dynamics and the recovery in market fundamentals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Turkey's consumption of construction-grade steel will continue to be fuelled by its <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://asiatimes.com/2020/08/erdogans-mega-projects-will-end-up-choking-istanbul/">"mega-projects"</a></span>, which include the expansion of Istanbul's <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/tourism/2020/01/01/state-of-art-istanbul-airport-to-display-aviation-hub-potential-in-2020">newest airport</a></span>, construction of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-canal/turkey-holds-first-tender-related-to-istanbul-canal-project-idUSKBN21D1WY">Istanbul Canal</a></span>, and the reconstruction of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-canal/turkey-holds-first-tender-related-to-istanbul-canal-project-idUSKBN21D1WY">bridges over the Bosphorus</a></span>.</p>
<p>On that basis, we calculate that Turkish HMS 1&amp;2 (80:20) import prices could climb as high as $325/t in the medium term as construction and infrastructure projects fuel steel and underlying ferrous scrap consumption.</p>
<p>We expect scrap benchmarks to reach those levels in the next couple of quarters rather than months, given that it would be too much of an adjustment for mills and end users to digest sooner, needing enough runway to incorporate higher costs into their finished steel prices.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com/ferrous-scrap-decoupling-from-iron-ore/">Ferrous scrap: decoupling from Iron Ore</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com">Navigate Commodities</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Turbulent times for the metallurgical coal markets</strong></h3>
<p>Major seaborne metallurgical premium hard coking coal prices have plunged 34.8% from a recent peak of $164/t, fob Australia, in early March to a trough of $107/t in early May.</p>
<p>Australia, the world’s largest seaborne metallurgical coal supplier, posted quarter-on-quarter declines in met coal shipments of 7.2% in Q1 and 2.1% in Q2 2020.</p>
<p>Demand for metallurgical coal, particularly Australian-origin material, has been decimated by sharp COVID-19-related contractions in blast furnace output in Europe, India, Japan, and South Korea.</p>
<h3><strong>When the Rest of the World steps back, China steps up</strong></h3>
<p>One saving grace for Australian metallurgical coal producers has been the emergence of China’s insatiable appetite for seaborne cargoes in the second quarter of 2020.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3095211/australia-becomes-chinas-top-source-coking-coal-stimulus">Australian metallurgical coal exports to China surged 49.5%</a></span> quarter-on-quarter to record highs of 15.8Mt in Q2 2020 compared with 10.6Mt the previous quarter.</p>
<p>This has partly been driven by <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-08/04/c_139263767.htm">reduced Mongolian supply availability after the country closed its border with China in March</a></span> which saw volumes drop to an 11-year low of 292kt in March.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chinese anticipation of a sharp rebound in steel and blast furnace output, as well as the substantial arbitrage between domestic versus seaborne supply has also driven bookings.</p>
<p>In early August, the cost of customs-cleared premium hard coking coal currently stands at $134/t (incl. 13% VAT) versus $187/t for equivalent domestic grades.</p>
<p>The significant arbitrage for Chinese buyers has also triggered opportunistic purchasing activity, despite the imposition of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6142f1b9-58cc-47e4-b2fb-8212ad792b2d">opaque import quotas to support the domestic coal industry</a></span>.</p>
<h3><strong>How have Chinese import quotas affected trade?</strong></h3>
<p>China introduced import restrictions and quotas in 2018 in a bid to shield domestic markets from volatile swings in major seaborne benchmarks.</p>
<p>Since that time, importers have front-loaded their purchases through the first three quarters of each year to avoid failing to clear customs once the allotted quotas dry up.</p>
<p>Moreover, front-loading has become more prevalent in response to significantly longer <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-coal-imports/china-curbs-coal-imports-after-5-months-of-record-inflows-sources-idUSKBN23I1QD">customs clearance times of up to 90 days</a></span> in some instances.</p>
<p>For those buyers that fail to clear customs when the import quota runs out, many have had to hold their material at port or sea to be declared the following calendar year.</p>
<p>In this tripartite system of domestic versus Australian versus Mongolia supply, Beijing has acted as a “fine tuner” for local markets given that imports account for only a fraction of overall consumption.</p>
<h3><strong>Where do metallurgical coal markets go from here?</strong></h3>
<p>The effects of a severe demand contraction from major metallurgical coal consuming nations have been partially offset by Chinese buyers front-loading their bookings and taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities.</p>
<p>Moreover, we estimate that the pace of supply cuts and disruptions in key producing and exporting nations, particularly Australia, Canada, Mongolia, Russia, and the US, is now relatively well-balanced with that of global seaborne demand.</p>
<p>We expect seaborne metallurgical coal markets to fall into a modest deficit in the third quarter as Chinese traders import greater volumes before quotas drying up, returning to a modest surplus in Q4 as Chinese buyers pull out of the market.</p>
<p>We then forecast that prices will recover to $145/t, fob Australia, in Q1 2021 as developed and emerging markets shake off the shackles of COVID-19 relation disruptions with expansive stimulus packages feeding through to steel-intensive (construction &amp; infrastructure) projects.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com/metallurgical-coal-turbulence-but-not-for-long/">Metallurgical coal turbulence, but not for long</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com">Navigate Commodities</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>Vehicle sales incentives mask real EU demand</strong></h3>
<p>Unilateral vehicle sales incentive schemes have helped deliver the much talked about “V-shaped” recovery in most major European economies over the past couple of months.</p>
<p>Governments have had to make the unpalatable decision of getting the wheels of their respective economies turning while trading-off the consequential longer-term impacts on the environment.</p>
<p>Stimulus packages announced by major EU countries will alleviate some pressure, although incentives will have a limited effect on structural medium to long-term vehicle sales.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, incentivized vehicle purchases have indeed provided an adrenaline boost, albeit temporarily, to the engine room of manufacturing activity.</p>
<p>After two months’ worth of new vehicle registration figures, a distinct picture is being painted of the impact scrappage incentive schemes have had on purchases of automobiles.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that recent car sales figures are a function of released pent up demand, after the relaxation of lockdown restrictions, and vehicle purchase schemes.</p>
<p>Almost all automobile associations and ministerial transportation departments report the performance of their respective automotive sectors on an annual like-for-like basis.</p>
<p>Seasonality, however, is relatively meaningless when market drivers have changed, with consumption fuelled by unilateral incentives to encourage part-exchanging to new(er) electric vehicles.</p>
<p>In countries where sales incentives and scrappage schemes have been implemented early (June) and have run their course by July, new registration figures look ominous for the road ahead.</p>
<h3><strong>What do the latest European new car sales figures look like for July?</strong></h3>
<p>For example, French car sales suggest that pent up demand and sales incentivized by a government scrappage scheme, which ended on July 31, have now begun to fizzle out.</p>
<p>The French Automobile Manufacturers Committee (CCFA) pointed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.autotimesnews.com/the-french-car-market-returned-to-growth-due-to-state-support-programs/">3.9% year-on-year sales growth in July</a></span> but stopped short at highlighting the 23.5% fall from the previous month when the incentive scheme’s quota was almost fully utilized.</p>
<p>In Spain, meanwhile, the automotive sector is currently benefitting from the government’s €3.75bn ($4.2bn) stimulus package and a reduction in Value Added Tax (VAT).</p>
<p>That said, stimulus-driven <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-spain-economy-pmi/spanish-factory-activity-grows-in-july-after-long-lockdown-car-sales-up-idUSKBN24Z0PI">car sales in Spain were only 1.1% higher in July</a></span> compared with the same month a year earlier in a period without intensive targeted incentives.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Italy, where the government was comparatively late in passing its incentive scheme, has likely witnessed the most transparent picture of where real consumption truly stands.</p>
<p>While Italy’s monthly new car sales appear to have levelled off at 130,000-140,000 units in June and July, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-car-registrations/italy-new-car-sales-fall-11-in-july-idUKKCN24Z258">sales still stand 11% lower on a year-on-year</a> </span>basis.</p>
<p>These sales volumes will likely be short-lived given that the Italian government recently announced that their <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-automotive/italy-to-introduce-subsidies-to-combustion-engine-cars-to-help-industry-lawmakers-idUSKBN2442HN">automotive sector support package would run from August to December</a></span>.</p>
<p>Thereafter, however, we anticipate that pent up demand and incentivized sales across Europe will eventually run out of steam, while several other factors will also undermine long-run sales figures.</p>
<h3><strong>What does the Long-Run recovery in European </strong><strong>vehicle sales </strong><strong>look like?</strong></h3>
<p>Consumer confidence is inextricably linked to employment levels, and with unemployment rates unlikely to materially recover for several quarters, purchases of big-ticket items will remain constrained.</p>
<p>At the same time, business and commercial vehicle sales will likely be a drag on headline figures, given heavily-reduced rentals from a decimated tourism industry exacerbated by a structural shift in “working from home” culture on corporate lease-hire fleets.</p>
<p>European countries that are less reliant on the automotive industry are unlikely to prolong or expand existing packages, while other sectors, such as tourism and transportation, will have to share state aid with the automobile industry.</p>
<p>Therefore, we expect the profusely talked about “V-shaped” recovery of European automotive and manufacturing industries to transform into a “W-shaped” recovery with an obtusely pronounced second leg recovery through 2021 and beyond.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com/vehicle-sales-incentives-mask-real-eu-demand/">Vehicle sales incentives mask real EU demand</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com">Navigate Commodities</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><strong>How has China been converted into a net steel importer?</strong></h3>
<p>In late 2019, China brought forward <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://navigatecommodities.com/ferrous-market-outlook-2020/">expansive special bond issuances, stimulus packages and easing monetary policy</a></span> to avoid a sharp economic slowdown (pre-COVID-19) through 2020.</p>
<p>China’s finance ministry stipulated that provincial governments had to disburse these special issuance bonds to immediately finance infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>Since that time, these programmes have been aggressively expanded over the past seven months to counter the negative impacts of COVID-19 on China’s economy.</p>
<p>For example, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3083268/china-coronavirus-stimulus-what-measures-have-been-used">special government bond issuances have been enlarged to a mighty RMB3.75 trillion ($540bn)</a></span> while a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3085654/coronavirus-china-unveils-us500-billion-fiscal-stimulus">RMB3.6 trillion ($520bn) stimulus package</a></span> has also been unveiled.</p>
<p>However, the effects of these most recent stimulus measures are unlikely to have a material impact on real demand for 6-9 months from the date of issuance.</p>
<p>Most pertinently, the stimuli and infrastructure-linked bond issuances released late last year will now have filtered through into the real economy over the past couple of months.</p>
<p>So much so that local steel producers have raised output 4.5% on a year-on-year basis to 91.6Mt in June in response to insatiable domestic consumption.</p>
<p>Despite daily crude steel output climbing to record highs of 3.05Mt per day in June, domestic production has been insufficient to meet local demand – particularly of long products.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly Chinese traders have ferociously swept up competitively priced cargoes from overseas markets, still suffering from the effects of COVID-19, to make up the shortfall.</p>
<p>On occasion, the discount between Chinese-produced steel and material sourced from the rest of the world has reached as high as over $50/mt; making it a profitable trade.</p>
<p>Latest customs data confirms the country <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-economy-trade-ironore/update-1-chinas-june-iron-ore-imports-hit-33-month-high-on-robust-demand-idUSL3N2EL0Z1">imported 4.36Mt of steel in June compared with 3.70Mt</a></span> – converting China into a net importer for the first time since 2009.</p>
<p>Most notably, Chinese imports have predominantly been made up of square and rectangular steel billets sourced from India, Russia, Iran, and Indonesia.</p>
<h3><strong>Is this a structural or cyclical change in market dynamics?</strong></h3>
<p>It is highly unlikely that China’s steel trade profile will revert to its long-run structural status as a mass net exporter any time within the next few months.</p>
<p>We believe the sheer size of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/06/china-stimulus-covid19-economic-recovery/">special bond issuance and fiscal stimulus package</a></span> will drive another 24-36 months of robust domestic steel consumption.</p>
<p>That is not to say that all additional Chinese apparent consumption growth will continue to be serviced by relatively larger import volumes.</p>
<p>It is highly likely that opportunistic local producers will ramp up output to new highs in response to this stimulus-driven demand.</p>
<p>Thereafter, Chinese demand for seaborne long products cargoes will only eventually diminish over time as overseas economies recover from their COVID-19 afflictions.</p>
<p>We anticipate rebounding stimulus-driven consumption in other major steel consuming nations will restrict the outflow of material and cause discounts to dissipate.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, expansive global COVID-19 stimulus programmes will continue to support the consumption and prices of the ferrous metals complex in our medium-term scenario.</p><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com/stimulus-converts-china-into-net-steel-importer/">Stimulus converts China into net steel importer</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://navigatecommodities.com">Navigate Commodities</a>.</p>
