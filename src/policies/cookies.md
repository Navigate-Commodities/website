# Cookies Policy

Navigate Commodities makes use of cookies and similar technologies throughout our websites to ensure your visit to our website goes smoothly.

## What are cookies?
Cookies (and similar technologies) are widely used on the internet and allow a website/portal to recognise a user’s device, without uniquely identifying the individual person using the computer. Cookies are small files which are stored on a user’s computer. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client or website. A cookie is sent by a web server to a web browser that enables the server to collect information back from the browser. This enables the site to recognize your computer each time you visit. These technologies help to make it easier for you to log on and use our websites and provide information to us, for example which parts of the website you visit.

For more information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set and how to manage, block and/or delete them, please refer to the below information about our Cookie Policy.

## Cookies we bake and use:

1. Strictly necessary cookies.
    These are cookies that are required for the operation of our website and our Apps. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our website, access gated articles or make use of e-billing services.

2. Analytical/performance cookies.
    These cookies allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website and when they are using them. This helps us to improve the way our website and our Apps work, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

3. Functionality cookies.
    These are used to recognise you when you return to our website. These enable us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences.

This website contains cookies from third-party websites, mainly social media cookies. When placed on your computer, they automatically activate handy extras, for example, a Facebook ‘like’ button or a Twitter messaging option. These cookies inform our website whether you are logged into such social media and they also enable you to share parts of this website on social media. When visiting this website, Payvision will ask for your consent to use these cookies.
