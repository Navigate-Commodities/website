### Types of Personal Data Held and its Use

1. **Customer Services and Administration**

    At some Sites, Navigate Commodities Pte. Ltd. collects personal data such as your name, job title, work and/or home address, and telephone number and email address in order to register you for access to certain content and subscriptions. This information may be supplemented with demographic information from your use of our Sites such as your postal area, age, gender, purchasing preferences and interests.

    At other Sites, Navigate Commodities Pte. Ltd. may only collect broad demographic information for aggregate use.

2. **Monitoring use of our Sites**

    Where, as part of our Site services, we enable you to post information or materials on our Site, we may access and monitor any information which you upload or input, including in any password-protected sections. Subject to any necessary consents, we also monitor and/or record the different Sites you visit, and actions taken on those Sites, e.g. content viewed or searched for. If you are a registered user (e.g. a subscriber or taking a trial), when you log on, this places a cookie on your machine. This enables your access to content and services that are not publicly available. Once you are logged on, the functional actions you take - for example, viewing an article – may be recorded.

3. **Cookies and similar technologies**

    All our Sites use cookies and similar technical tools to collect information about your access to the Site and the services we provide.

    Cookies are pieces of information which include a unique reference code that a website transfers to your device to store and sometimes track information about you. A number of cookies we use last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. Other cookies are used to remember you when you return to the Site and will last for longer. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. They are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie.

    We may use cookies to:

    -  remember that you have used the Site before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to different parts of the Site. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get and make sure that the Site runs fast enough;

    -  remember your login session so you can move from one page to another within the Site; or store your preferences or your user name and password so that you do not need to input these every time you visit the Site;

    -  customise elements of the layout and/or content of the pages of Site for you;

    -  record activity on our Sites so that we understand how you use our Sites enabling us to better tailor our content, services and marketing to your needs;

    -  collect statistical information about how you use the Site so that we can improve the Site;

    -  gather information about the pages on the Site that you visit, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a “market segment”. This information is only collected by reference to the IP address that you are using, but does include information about the county and city you are in, together with the name of your internet service provider. This information is then used to place interest-based advertisements on the Site which it is believed will be relevant to your market segment. Some of the cookies used by our Sites are set by us, and some are set by third parties who are delivering services (such as interest-based advertising directed at your market segment) on our behalf.

    Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but, if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that or to notify you each time a cookie is set. You can also learn more about cookies in general by visiting www.allaboutcookies.org which includes additional useful information on cookies and how to block cookies using different types of browser. Please note however, that by blocking, deleting or turning off cookies used on the Site you may not be able to take full advantage of the Site.

### Email tracking

So that we can better understand our users` needs, we track responses to our   emails - for example, to see which links are the most popular in newsletters, and to log and follow up responses to our marketing messages. To do this, we use pixel GIFs, also known as "pixel tags" - these are small image files that are placed within the body of our email messages. They enable us to tell if a message has been opened and to track click-throughs on links within the message.

### Consents and opt-outs

You can give your consent to or opt out of particular uses of your data as indicated above by:

- Indicating at the point on the relevant Site where personal data is collected;
- Informing us by email, post or phone; or
- Updating your preferences on the applicable Site;

### Marketing Communication

We, our group companies or other third-party service providers may send you marketing communications if you have agreed to receive such communications and in each case you have not opted-out of receiving such communications, or you have asked for information about us and requested we keep you updated about our business and services. We believe as a commercial enterprise we do have a legitimate interest in contacting you about our products or services by utilizing your personal data, and we will only do so if we decide it would be of interest or beneficial for you.

### Disclosures

Information collected at one Site may be shared between Navigate Commodities Pte. Ltd. and other group companies for the purposes listed above (“purposes of data collected”).

We may also disclose your personal data to other third parties, including, without limitation, professional advisers, or governmental or State institutions or regulatory authorities, where necessary in order to exercise or defend legal rights or where required by law.

### Public forums, message boards and blogs

Some of our Sites make message boards, blogs or other facilities for user generated content available and users can participate in these facilities. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should always be careful when deciding to disclose your personal information.

### Confidentiality and Security of Your Personal Data

We are committed to keeping the data you provide us secure and will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal data from loss, misuse or alteration.

We also give you the option of using a secure transmission method to send us personal data identifiers, such as credit card details and bank account number.
