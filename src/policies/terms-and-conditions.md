Means of accessing the Sites and/or Services
7.1 You may access a Site as follows:

(a) if you go through a registration process on that Site (if available), as a Registered User (in accordance with Clause 10 below);

(b) if you register as a Subscriber to our subscription Services (which we may offer, in accordance with Clauses 10 and 12 below); or

7.2 You are responsible for procuring the necessary equipment and the payment of telephone, internet and other charges necessary to access and/or use any Site and/or Service. We are not responsible for the reliability or continued availability of the telephone lines, internet and equipment you use to access and/or use a Site and/or Service.

Cross-jurisdiction provision of Content
8.1 Any Content sent for delivery across jurisdictions may be subject to import duties and taxes collected at the final destination. All sales or use taxes, import duties or additional customs charges must be borne entirely by you. We have no control over these charges and we expressly disclaim any responsibility or liability for them. Customs policies vary widely from country to country, and you may wish to contact your local customs office for further information.

8.2 Additionally, when ordering from us or any other Group Company, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all law and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the goods. Our international customers should be aware that cross-border deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities. We may provide certain order, delivery and product information (such as the product's title) to our international carriers and such information may be communicated by the carriers to customs authorities in order to facilitate customs clearance and compliance with local laws. If the order is a gift, the package will be marked 'Gift' but the cost or value of the item may still be stated on the customs form and/or the package.

Our provisions of the Sites and/or Services
9.1 Subject to and without limitation to Clause 21, we will exercise reasonable skill and care in our provision of the Sites and/or Services to Registered Users and Subscribers, but from time to time faults may occur, in which case, we will use reasonable efforts to rectify them as soon as reasonably practicable.

9.2 We will endeavour to ensure all subscriptions or other Services (where applicable) are priced correctly on the Sites and/or in the Content. However, errors may occur. If such a pricing error is discovered, we reserve the right to give you the option of either cancelling your order for any particular subscription or other Service or reconfirming your order at the correct price.

Registrations and subscriptions
10.1 To access certain Sites (or specific Content within certain Sites), and/or to receive certain Services, you must register with us as either a Registered User or a Subscriber, as follows:

(a) for certain Sites, where Content and/or Services are available free of charge once you register with us, you may access or receive such Content and/or Services subject to these Terms as a Registered User; or

(b) in certain instances, where charges are payable for the receipt of certain Services (which may include access to certain Sites and Content), you may access such Services subject to these Terms as a Subscriber who has paid the relevant fees and/or charges (in accordance with Clause 12 below) for a specified period of time, a specified number of licensed users and/or a site licence.

10.2 In order to register with us, you must provide us with accurate and complete information. You represent to us that such information is true, accurate and up to date, and it is your responsibility to inform us of any changes to that information (including, without limitation, your email address), by updating your details on the relevant section of the applicable Site or by contacting us using our contact details on the applicable Site. If you do not provide accurate and complete information to us when you register, we may not be able to provide the Sites, Services and/or Content that you request for.

10.3 In certain instances, before you can make use of certain Services associated with a particular Site as a Registered User, you may need to create an account connected through Connected Networks. You understand that the creation of a Registered User account through the Connected Networks will require a connection to be created between the Site and the Connected Networks to facilitate your participation and activities on the Site.

10.4 When you register, you will be given one or more usernames and passwords, as appropriate for your registration or subscription to the relevant Site and/or Service.

10.5 Except to the extent that a username and password is intended for more than one licensed user as expressly agreed to by us in writing, the following are strictly prohibited:

(a) the sharing of their username and/or password (whether intentional or otherwise) by a Registered User, Subscriber or licensed user under any registration and/or subscription with any other person or entity (including with any Agent of such user); and/or

(b) access through a single username and password being made available to multiple users (whether on the same network or otherwise).

For the avoidance of doubt, the above will constitute a breach of these Terms and may result in the immediate termination of your registration, subscription and/or licence, and without limitation, a claim for damages or otherwise, being brought by us against you.

10.6 To the extent that the terms of a multiple-user licence restricts licensed users to a particular category of individuals (e.g. employees of your organisation), you must notify us immediately, using the customer service contact details applicable to your registration and/or subscription, if a licensed user ceases to fall within the specified category.

10.7 Notwithstanding the restrictions in Clause 10.5 above, you are responsible for all access and use of any Site and/or Service by you or anyone else using any of your user names and passwords and for preventing unauthorised use of any of your user names and passwords. If you believe that there has been any breach of security and/or unauthorised use (such as the disclosure, theft or unauthorised use of any user name, password or any payment information), you must notify us immediately by emailing [email protected].

Information relating to your subscription
11.1 We reserve the right to access and monitor password-protected information, including any information which you upload or input and any information concerning your activities in relation to a Service, a Site and/or any Content, in order for us to fulfil our obligations in respect of these Terms, to protect or comply with our legal rights and obligations and for other purposes as set out in our Privacy Policy.
